**Expected Result**: No controlled input errors, column mappings update correctly

## Regression Testing

### 1. Cross-Browser Testing
**Objective**: Verify that the fixes work across different browsers
**Steps**:
1. Repeat all test cases in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. Monitor for any browser-specific errors

## Error Monitoring

### 1. Console Error Monitoring
**Objective**: Continuously monitor for any controlled input errors
**Steps**:
1. Keep browser developer tools open during all testing
2. Document any errors that appear
3. Investigate and fix any new errors that are discovered

**Expected Result**: No controlled input errors during testing

### 2. React Developer Tools
**Objective**: Use React Developer Tools to inspect component state
**Steps**:
1. Install React Developer Tools browser extension
2. Use the Components tab to inspect input components
3. Verify that input values are always controlled

**Expected Result**: All input components show as controlled with proper values

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Testing (1-2 days)
- Execute all component-specific test cases
- Document any issues found
- Fix any issues before proceeding to integration testing

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (1-2 days)
- Test components in the context of the full application
- Verify that data flows correctly between components
- Test user workflows that involve multiple components

### Phase 3: Regression Testing (1 day)
- Execute cross-browser testing
- Perform performance testing
- Conduct accessibility testing

### Phase 4: Sign-off (1 day)
- Review all test results
- Ensure all critical issues are resolved
- Prepare final test report

## Success Criteria

The controlled input error is considered resolved if:
1. No controlled input errors appear in the browser console during any test
2. All input components remain controlled throughout their lifecycle
3. All user interactions work correctly
4. No new errors are introduced
5. The application works correctly across all supported browsers

## Conclusion

By following this comprehensive testing plan, we can ensure that the controlled input error has been properly resolved and that the application remains stable and user-friendly.
