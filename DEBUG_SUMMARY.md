  - Fixed drawdown calculations with `Math.max(0, ...)` guards
  - Enhanced phase progression with proper bounds checking
  - Improved payout eligibility with safe defaults
  - Added validation for negative values and edge cases

### 3. **API Endpoint Robustness**
- **Issue**: API endpoints returning invalid data or failing on edge cases
- **Fix**: Enhanced all API routes with proper error handling and safe defaults
- **Files Updated**:
  - `app/api/prop-firm/accounts/[id]/trades/route.ts`
  - `app/api/prop-firm/accounts/[id]/route.ts`
  - `app/api/prop-firm/accounts/route.ts`
  - `app/api/prop-firm/payouts/route.ts`

### 4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent data handling across the system
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive data validation and sanitization
- **Improvements**:
  - Safe defaults for all numeric values
  - Proper handling of null/undefined values
  - Bounds checking for percentages and amounts
  - Consistent data transformation in API responses

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Business Logic Enhancements

#### Drawdown Calculation
```typescript
// Before: Could fail with negative values
const dailyDD = safeDailyStartBalance - safeCurrentEquity

// After: Safe with proper bounds
const dailyDD = Math.max(0, safeDailyStartBalance - safeCurrentEquity)
```

#### Phase Progression
```typescript
// Before: Could exceed 100% or go negative
result.profitProgress = (safeNetProfit / currentPhase.profitTarget) * 100

// After: Properly bounded
result.profitProgress = Math.min(100, Math.max(0, (safeNetProfit / currentPhase.profitTarget) * 100))
```

#### Payout Eligibility
```typescript
// Before: Could fail with negative days
if (daysSinceFunded < minDaysToFirstPayout) { ... }

// After: Safe with proper validation
const safeDaysSinceFunded = Math.max(0, daysSinceFunded)
if (safeDaysSinceFunded < minDaysToFirstPayout) { ... }
```
