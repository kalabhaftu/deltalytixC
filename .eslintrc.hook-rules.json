  "// EXPLANATION": "Custom ESLint configuration for React Hooks",
  "// PURPOSE": "Provides granular control over exhaustive-deps warnings",
  "// USAGE": "Extend this in .eslintrc.json to customize hook rules",
  
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": [
      "warn",
      {
        "additionalHooks": "(useStableCallback|useStableAsyncCallback|useDebouncedCallback)"
      }

  "// COMMON FIXES": {
    "1. Missing Dependencies": {
      "problem": "React Hook has a missing dependency",
      "solutions": [
        "Add the dependency to the array",
        "Use useCallback/useMemo to stabilize the dependency",
        "Use useStableCallback if you need latest values without re-creating",
        "Add // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps if intentional"
      ]
    },
    "2. Unnecessary Dependencies": {
      "problem": "React Hook has an unnecessary dependency",
      "solutions": [
        "Remove the dependency (e.g., 'toast', stable imports)",
        "Verify the value actually causes re-renders",
        "Check if it's a stable reference (useCallback, imported function)"
      ]
    },
    "3. Complex Expressions": {
      "problem": "React Hook has a complex expression in dependency array",
      "solutions": [
        "Extract the expression to a variable with useMemo",
        "Use a stable reference with useCallback",
        "Simplify the dependency to a primitive value"
      ]
    },
    "4. Ref Cleanup Issues": {
      "problem": "Ref value will likely have changed by cleanup time",
      "solutions": [
        "Copy ref.current to a variable inside the effect",
        "Use the copied variable in the cleanup function",
        "Example: const element = ref.current; return () => cleanup(element)"
      ]
    }
  },
  
  "// PERFORMANCE IMPACT": {
    "High": [
      "Missing callback dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders",
      "Unnecessary dependencies triggering effect loops",
      "Complex expressions recalculating on every render"
    ],
    "Medium": [
      "Missing effect dependencies causing stale closures",
      "Improper ref usage in effects"
    ],
    "Low": [
      "Unnecessary deps on stable values (just noise)",
      "eslint-disable comments (technical debt)"
    ]
  }
